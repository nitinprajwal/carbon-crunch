**Step 1: Set Up the FastAPI Backend**  
- **Objective:** Build a backend service to handle file uploads and analysis.  
- **Tools/Technologies:**  
  - FastAPI (for the backend framework)  
  - Uvicorn (for running the ASGI server)  
- **Actions:**  
  - Initialize a FastAPI project by creating a main application file (e.g., `main.py`).  
  - Install required packages (FastAPI and Uvicorn) using your preferred package manager.  
  - Create an endpoint (e.g., `/analyze-code`) that accepts file uploads.  
  - Use FastAPI's file upload support to receive files with extensions `.py`, `.js`, or `.jsx`.  
  - Implement logic to store the uploaded file temporarily in a specific directory (e.g., `./temp_files/`).  
  - Validate the file type based on the file extension before proceeding to analysis.

**Step 2: Configure Linting Tools**  
- **Objective:** Set up code quality analysis tools that evaluate the code based on various clean code practices.  
- **Tools/Technologies:**  
  - **For Python Files:** Pylint with a custom configuration file (e.g., `.pylintrc`).  
  - **For JavaScript/React Files:** ESLint with React-specific plugins and a custom configuration file (e.g., `.eslintrc`).  
- **Actions:**  
  - For Python, configure Pylint to enforce rules for naming conventions, function length/modularity, documentation, formatting, and code duplication.  
  - For JavaScript, configure ESLint to enforce similar code quality rules with plugins for React components.  
  - Ensure both tools are configured to output results in JSON format so that the output can be easily parsed and processed later.

**Step 3: Implement the Code Analysis Logic**  
- **Objective:** Process the outputs from the linting tools, calculate scores, and generate recommendations.  
- **Tools/Technologies:**  
  - JSON parsing methods available in your backend language (Python).  
- **Actions:**  
  - Create logic to run the appropriate linting tool based on the file extension (Pylint for `.py` files; ESLint for `.js` and `.jsx` files).  
  - Parse the JSON output from these tools to identify violations and errors.  
  - Categorize the issues into key areas such as:  
    - Naming conventions (10 points)  
    - Function length and modularity (20 points)  
    - Comments and documentation (20 points)  
    - Formatting/indentation (15 points)  
    - Reusability and DRY principles (15 points)  
    - Best practices in web development (20 points)  
  - Develop a scoring system where you start from 100 and deduct points based on the number of violations in each category (each category can have its specific deduction multiplier).  
  - Select the top 3–5 violations based on severity (errors prioritized over warnings) to generate clear, actionable recommendations.

**Step 4: AI Integration with Grok**  
- **Objective:** Enhance the recommendations by integrating an AI model to summarize and rephrase code analysis feedback.  
- **Tools/Technologies:**  
  - Grok API
- **Actions:**  
  - Research the Grok API documentation to understand how to integrate it into your application.  
  - Create a module that sends the code analysis data and the original code from user to Grok for enhanced insights.  
  - Use the response from Grok to refine the recommendations—this might include rephrasing feedback for clarity or suggesting more detailed refactoring options.  
  - Ensure that this integration is optional and can be activated after the core functionality is implemented.

**Step 5: Set Up the React Frontend – Expanded UI Details**

- **Initial File Upload Interface:**  
  - Create a clean, welcoming UI that immediately invites the user to upload a code file (`.py`, `.js`, or `.jsx`).  
  - Include a prominent file input component (using `<input type="file" />`) and clear instructions on acceptable file formats.  
  - Add an upload button that triggers the file selection process.

- **Display Uploaded Code:**  
  - Once the file is uploaded, immediately display the code in a read-only code editor or a nicely formatted text area.  
  - Ensure proper syntax highlighting and formatting so that the user can easily review the code as it appears in the file.  
  - The code display area should be scrollable and well-sized to accommodate larger files, ensuring that line breaks, indentation, and styling remain intact.

- **Processing Trigger:**  
  - Below the code display area, provide a clearly labeled submit button (e.g., “Analyze Code”).  
  - When the user clicks this button, the frontend sends the file (or the displayed code) to the FastAPI backend for processing.
  
- **Results and Comparison Section:**  
  - After processing, split the UI into two main rectangular panels side-by-side or stacked:  
    - **Left Panel – Original Code:**  
      - This panel continues to show the original code as uploaded by the user.  
      - The formatting remains intact for reference.
    - **Right Panel – AI-Enhanced Code:**  
      - This panel displays the improved version of the code generated by AI.  
      - It should highlight the changes or enhancements, making it easy for the user to compare both versions.
  
- **Detailed Results Display:**  
  - Further down the page, include a dedicated section for detailed analysis results.  
  - This section should feature:  
    - A summary of the overall score and category breakdown (e.g., naming, modularity, documentation, formatting, reusability, and best practices).  
    - Graphs or visual representations (like bar charts or pie charts) that make it easy to understand the distribution of scores across different categories.  
    - A list of recommendations detailing specific areas for improvement based on the analysis.
  
- **User Interaction and Flow:**  
  - The UI should be intuitive:  
    1. **Upload File:** The user selects a file.
    2. **Review Code:** The code is displayed with proper formatting and syntax highlighting.
    3. **Submit for Analysis:** A prominent submit button triggers the analysis.
    4. **View Comparison:** Once processed, the user can scroll to see both the original and AI-enhanced code in separate panels for a side-by-side comparison.
    5. **Detailed Insights:** At the bottom, additional detailed graphs and results provide a comprehensive view of the code analysis.
  
- **Responsive and Accessible Design:**  
  - Ensure the layout is responsive so that it works well on different devices and screen sizes.  
  - Provide clear labels, tooltips, or help texts to guide the user through the process, making the experience both accessible and user-friendly.

**Step 6: GitHub Actions Integration**  
- **Objective:** Automate code analysis on commits and pull requests using GitHub Actions.  
- **Tools/Technologies:**  
  - GitHub Actions (for continuous integration)  
- **Actions:**  
  - Write a script (for example, a standalone Python script) that can run the code analysis for a given file and output the results in JSON format.  
  - Create a GitHub Action workflow YAML file (e.g., `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`) that:  
    - Triggers on commits or pull requests.  
    - Runs the analysis script on the relevant files.  
    - Captures the JSON output from the analysis.  
    - Posts the analysis results as comments on the pull request, if applicable.

---

**Step 7: Documentation and Final Deliverables**  
- **Objective:** Prepare a comprehensive guide and organize the project repository.  
- **Tools/Technologies:**  
  - Markdown (for documentation)  
- **Actions:**  
  - Organize the repository into clear directories, such as:  
    - `/backend` for the FastAPI application  
    - `/frontend` for the React application  
    - `/config` for configuration files (e.g., `.pylintrc`, `.eslintrc`)  
  - Write a README file that includes:  
    - Detailed setup instructions (e.g., installing Python 3.12+, Node.js 20+).  
    - How to install dependencies (using pip and npm/yarn).  
    - How to run the backend and frontend.  
    - Instructions for testing the tool using sample code files.  
  - Include sample test files (e.g., `sample.py` and `sample.jsx`) to demonstrate how the tool works.  
  - Mention that Grok AI is used to provide summarized insights and recommendations by comparing the original lint output with the improved suggestions.
